# **Big Mart Sales Prediction ðŸš€**  

## **Overview**  
This project uses **machine learning** to predict sales for Big Mart stores based on historical data. The model leverages **XGBoost** for accurate forecasting, helping in demand prediction, inventory management, and revenue optimization.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Scikit-learn  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of sales records from multiple stores with features such as:  
- **Item Type, Outlet Size, Outlet Type, MRP, Establishment Year, and Sales History**  
- Data Source: [Kaggle - Big Mart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data)  

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying sales trends, outliers, and feature correlations.  
3. **Model Training**: Implemented **XGBoost** with hyperparameter tuning for best performance.  
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Used **RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²** to assess model accuracy.  
5. **Predictions & Insights**: Generated sales forecasts to optimize inventory and pricing strategies.  

## **Results**  
- Achieved **high accuracy** in sales prediction using XGBoost.  
- Provided **data-driven insights** for efficient stock management.  
- Helped businesses optimize pricing and sales strategies.
